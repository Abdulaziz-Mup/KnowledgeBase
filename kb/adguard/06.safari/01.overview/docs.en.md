AdGuard for Safari was released in November, 2018 and soon became one of the most popular ad blockers for this browser. It [replaced](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-safari-extension.html) our classic browser extension that existed before Apple’s restrictions, and we had to do our best to make the current extension comparable to the previous one. AdGuard for Safari can’t be compared to full-fledged desktop ad blocking apps, but has many virtues.  

It’s free and it will protect you from ads, trackers, phishing, and malicious websites. But first things first.
