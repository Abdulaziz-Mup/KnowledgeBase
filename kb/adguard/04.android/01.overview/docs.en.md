> Disclaimer: AdGuard for Android is not to be confused with AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard Content Blocker is an app available in Google Play that has truncated functionality to meet restrictions imposed by the store. AdGuard for Android, on the other hand, is a powerful application to block ads, manage applications, and perform other roles that will be described in this article. The only place it can be downloaded from is [the AdGuard website](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html).

# Ad blocking

Any ad blocker's main purpose is to block ads and for the majority of AdGuard software ad blocking algorithms are mostly the same. The mechanism of filtering ads is described [here](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-ad-blocking-works).
