There already exists [AdGuard for Android](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html), one might think, why would they need another app? Let’s see.

Full-fledged ad blockers can’t be introduced in Google Play due to the policy of the store. Google Play [banned](https://adguard.com/en/blog/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play.html) ‘apps that [block or interfere with](https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/03/01/google-explicitly-bans-ad-blockers-from-the-play-store-except-all-those-ad-blocking-web-browsers-apparently/) another app displaying ads’.

As an alternative, Google offers to developers the Content blocking API. It has its limitations though, and quite severe. Currently, this API is supported only by two browsers: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser.

A lot of complicated filtering rules that are supported in other AdGuard products are not functioning with this API. As a result, the ad blocking capabilities of AdGuard Content Blocker are far lower than those of AdGuard for Android, for example.
