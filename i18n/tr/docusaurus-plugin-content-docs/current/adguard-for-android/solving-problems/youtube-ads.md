One of the most popular questions users ask us is: 'Is it possible to block ads in YouTube on Android?'. Due to the technical restrictions of the Android OS, there is no way to *completely* remove ads from the YouTube app. But we've found an alternative that brings you to it as close as possible, while getting around the Android-imposed restrictions.


## Watch YouTube in the AdGuard app

1. Open the YouTube app and start the video you want to watch.
2. Tap the *Share* button and select *AdGuard for Android* from the list of apps.

Bu kadar! A new window with the video will open where you'll be able to watch it without being interrupted by ads.

* You can also watch YouTube in a browser and there will be no ads if you have AdGuard installed and enabled.
