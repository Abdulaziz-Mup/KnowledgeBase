이 문서는 시스템 수준에서 기기를 보호하는 다기능 광고 차단기인 Mac용 AdGuard에 대해 다룹니다. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

The main window of AdGuard for Mac allows you to enable or disable the AdGuard protection. It also gives you a quick overview of the app’s stats: ads, trackers, and threats blocked since you’ve installed AdGuard or since your last stats reset. By clicking the gear icon, you can access settings, check for app and filter updates, contact support, and manage your license.
