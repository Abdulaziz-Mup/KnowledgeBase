## Installation

Most Android-based apps are distributed via Google Play; however, AdGuard is not presented there, because Google prohibits distribution of network-level ad blockers via Google Play, i.e. apps that block commercials in other apps. You will find more information about Google restrictive policy [in our blog](https://blog.adguard.com/en/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play/).

Thatâ€™s why you can only install AdGuard for Android manually. To use the app on your mobile device, you will need to do the following.

1. **Download the app on your device**. Here are a few ways you can do this:

    * head over to [our website](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html) and tap the *Download* button
    * start the browser and type in the following URL: [https://adguard.com/apk](https://adguard.com/apk)
    * or scan this QR code

2. **Allow installing apps from unknown sources**. Once the file download is complete, tap *Open* in the notification.

A popup will appear. Tap *Settings*, navigate to *Install unknown apps*, and grant permission for the browser you've used to download the file.

This guide is for Android 8+. If you have an older OS version, before downloading the apk file, go to *Settings* and select *Additional settings* in *System & Device*. Enable *Unknown sources* and tap *OK* in the system warning window.

3. **Install the app**. Once the browser secures the necessary permission, the system will ask you if you want to install the AdGuard app. Tap *Install*.

You will then be asked to read the *License agreement* and AdGuard's *Privacy Policy*. You can also participate in product development. To do this, you should check boxes *Send crash reports automatically* and *Send technical and interaction data*. Tap *Continue* after that.

4. **Create a local VPN**. To filter all the traffic right on your device and not to rout it through a remote server AdGuard needs to set up a VPN connection.

5. **Enable HTTPS filtering**. It is not a mandatory option, however, we advice to turn it on for the best ad-blocking quality.

If your device runs on Android 7-9, after setting up a local VPN, you'll be prompted with a screen to install a root certificate and configure HTTPS filtering.

After you hit *Install now*, a prompt will pop up requesting you to authenticate the certificate installation using a password or fingerprint.

If you have Android 10+ on your device, then after creating a local VPN, you will see the main app screen with a snack bar at the bottom: tap *Enable* and follow the instructions on the next screen.
