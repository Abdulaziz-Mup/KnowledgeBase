In an effort to improve user privacy, Google has expanded the restriction settings in Android 15. More settings, such as *App usage access*, now require an additional permission to be enabled. Since the *Firewall* and *Detect Samsung Pay* features require *App usage access* permissions to work properly, you may have experienced problems using them.  To resolve these issues, please follow the steps below:

:::note

AdGuard has a strict no-logging policy, which means that we do not collect your data or send it to third parties. We only ask for access to data without which the application cannot function.

:::

1. On your Android device, open the **Settings app**.
1. Tap **Apps**.
1. Tap **AdGuard**

If you can't find it, first tap See all apps or App info.

1. Tap **More** (⁝) → *Allow restricted settings*.
