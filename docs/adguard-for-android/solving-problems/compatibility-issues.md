### VPN apps

Other VPN apps are incompatible with AdGuard running in the Local VPN filtering mode since you cannot have two active VPNs at the same time. To solve this problem we suggest you:

* use [AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/ro/welcome.html) â€” it has Integrated mode that allows two apps to operate seamlessly
* use AdGuard in Local HTTP Proxy mode. *Please note that 'manual' HTTP Proxy mode is not supported on devices since Android 10*
* if you use a third-party VPN app, figure out whether it supports SOCKS4/SOCKS5 mode. If it does, you can configure your VPN app to work as outbound proxy and set up local outbound proxy with params from the third-party app. For instance, AdGuard can be automatically configured with 'Orbot: Proxy with Tor'

### Private DNS

The Private DNS feature was introduced in Android Pie. Before version Q, Private DNS didn't break AdGuard DNS filtering logic and the DNS forwarding through AdGuard worked normally. But starting from version Q, the presence of Private DNS forces apps to redirect traffic through the system resolver instead of AdGuard. See Android [devs blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html) for more details.

> Some device manufacturers keep Private DNS settings hidden and set 'Automatic' mode as a default one. Thus, disabling Private DNS is impossible but we can make the system think that the upstream is not valid. The system will use AdGuard as a bootstrap for the first host resolution and we can block it with a `$network` rule. A failed bootstrap request causes the system to redirect DNS traffic through AdGuard.

### Unsupported browsers

1. **UC Browsers**: UC Browser, UC Browser for x86, UC Mini, UC Browser HD

By default, AdGuard filters the UC Browser without any problems. However, if you enable "data compression" in that browser, AdGuard won't be able to apply HTTPS filtering.

**Solution**

The only solution is to not enable data compression in UC Browser.

2. **Opera mini**: Opera mini, Opera mini with Yandex

Opera mini drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time.

**Solution**

There is no solution at this moment.

3. **Dolphin Browser**: Dolphin Browser, Dolphin Browser Express

AdGuard cannot filter its traffic when operating in **Manual proxy mode** because this browser ignores system proxy settings.

**Solution**

There is no solution at this moment.

4. **Puffin Browser**: Puffin Browser, Puffin Browser Pro

Puffin Browser drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time.

**Solution**

There is no solution at this moment.
