Blocking ads is clearly the key functionality of any ad blocker, and AdGuard is not an exception. The extension will successfully block ads on any page in your browser. Ad blocking is based on so-called filter lists, or simply [filters](/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works). Filters can be enabled or disabled in your extension's settings. You can customize ad blocking by activating specific filters.
