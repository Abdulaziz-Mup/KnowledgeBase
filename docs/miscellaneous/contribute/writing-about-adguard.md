If you like AdGuard and want to spread the word and share your impressions of AdGuard product(s) over the internet — in social media, on a personal blog or website — then this article can be of interest to you.

Once you share your experience online, send an email to [pr@adguard.com](mailto:pr@adguard.com) and include a link to your post. We'll send a 'Thank you' message back, and the authors of the best written reviews will even get a free AdGuard license key. It does not really matter if your website's audience is ten people or a thousand, we respect every effort. The only note to keep in mind is that your review should be roughly about 300 to 500 words.

If you want to make a video about AdGuard or to do anything else off-beat, please let us know in advance to avoid any possible misunderstandings. The same applies if your plan includes the use of AdGuard logo, banners, or other visual elements. The contact email remains the same: [pr@adguard.com](mailto:pr@adguard.com).
