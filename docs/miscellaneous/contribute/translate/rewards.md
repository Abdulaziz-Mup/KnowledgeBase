As any honest and well-performed effort should be rewarded, active translators on Crowdin can request a free AdGuard license key and a VPN subscription.

To request a **one-year AdGuard license key** or a **one-year AdGuard VPN subscription**, you must translate at least 500 and 2,500 words respectively.

**What the whole system looks like**

```
We give the first one-year AdGuard license for 500 translated words,
the second key – for 1,500 words,
the third key – for 3,000 words,
the fourth – for 4,500 words, and so on. 

As for AdGuard VPN subscriptions, we give the first one for 2,500 translated words,
the second one – for 5,000 words,
the third one – for 7,500 words, and so on.

```
Just send us a request to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) and you’ll get the license as a token of our gratitude.

Besides, the most active translators may receive proofreader status in the future, should they express such an intention, and that promises even more good stuff.

Every year we present gifts with the AdGuard logo to our active proofreaders. If you want to become one of them, please write to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com).
