As any honest and well-performed effort should be rewarded, active volunteer translators on Crowdin can request a free AdGuard license key.

To request a **one-year** license key, you must translate at least 500 words ONLY in **previously untranslated** strings.

Just send us a request to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) and youâ€™ll get the license key as a token of our gratitude.

Besides, the most active translators may receive [proofreader status](become-a-translator-->proofreaders) in the future, should they express such an intention by sending an email to the same address: [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com). And that promises even more good stuff!

Every year we choose our best proofreaders and send them gifts with AdGuard logo. Follow the news on [our blog](https://adguard.com/en/blog/index.html).
