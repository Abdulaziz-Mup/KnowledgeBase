## AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard VPN for Windows compatibility issues

Once you install AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard VPN for Windows, they just start working together without any effort on your part. However, changing some default settings may prevent the apps from working correctly when running simultaneously.

There are two specific settings in AdGuard for Windows: *Use redirect driver mode* and *Filter localhost*. By default, the first one is disabled and the latter one is enabled. Changing any of these settings will inevitably disrupt AdGuard's filtering if both AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN are enabled on your device.   

Changing these settings is only required to overcome issues related to the simultaneous operation of AdGuard Ad Blocker and apps working on the network level (e.g. antiviruses, VPNs, network filters, etc). If you come across a situation where you need AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN to work simultaneously and correctly, and the default state of the above settings needs to be changed â€” [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/new/choose) so we can help you personally.

We are currently working on overcoming the above-listed limitations of the simultaneous work of our apps.
