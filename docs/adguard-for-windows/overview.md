AdGuard has been created to make your browsing experience pleasant and comfortable. It is not just a web filter and ad blocker – it is a convenient and fully adjustable tool that helps you save your traffic, load your web pages faster, and protect your computer from undesirable and potentially malicious content. With AdGuard, you can forget all about annoying banners and popup windows. This is not the whole scope of the application’s capabilities, though. AdGuard will protect you from phishing websites, and your children from information they should not yet come across due to age restrictions. However, everything in its turn.

Adguard’s main function is filtering ads on websites you are visiting. It doesn’t matter which browser you use – AdGuard works perfectly fine with any website-viewing applications. If your browser is not included in the list of default ones, you can add it there without any trouble. Apart from utilizing the ready-made set of filters, the user can block select objects on the pages they are viewing or turn off filtering for certain websites. AdGuard not only filters the built-in banners on web pages but also prevents popup windows from opening and advertising clips from appearing when you watch online videos.

An important feature of AdGuard for Windows is that it filters off the ads even before the web page is loaded in the browser, thus significantly lowering the Internet data sharing (which is an important factor if you pay for traffic use) and accelerating web surfing. Apart from filtering ads, AdGuard for Windows protects its users from potential malware, spyware, and fraudulent websites. The so-called phishing Internet sites are of particular concern.

>Phishing is a common web fraud aimed at stealing your personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks.

A special module, Browsing Security, protects AdGuard for Windows users from this type of fraud and warns them of attempts at redirection to potentially malicious websites. The Browsing Security database is updated automatically, and is always up-to-date.

Every person working on the Internet leaves invisible footsteps there: counters built in websites gather information about their IP-address (and, therefore, about their current location), their browser version, operating system, screen resolution, and lots of other data. A site can mark your browser with cookies to gather your statistics, save your settings, or automatically identify you upon repeat visit. Your personal data and private information will be secure with another AdGuard module called Stealth Mode. Stealth Mode will always keep you safe and sound.

The Internet may be a dangerous place for young users. Violence, adult themes, crude language, gambling, drug propaganda – this list is far from complete where it concerns the information children should be restricted from. AdGuard Parental Control module will help you with this. Just turn it on, set the filter sensitivity, and you don’t have to worry that your child will stumble upon an inappropriate website anymore. Parental Control also allows you to turn on filtering of search results and set a password to protect AdGuard settings. Now you won’t need to buy separate applications to filter web content – with AdGuard, your family will always be well-protected.

## Ad Blocker


This is the main module of AdGuard for Windows that filters off ads on websites viewed by the user and in the user’s installed apps. Ad Blocker clears web pages of advertising images and messages using specific rules. The undesirable content is filtered even before the page is loaded in the browser, which helps save a lot of traffic.

Ad Blocker is flexibly adjusted to your needs, so you can add any object on pages you are viewing to the blocking rules, or turn off filtering on select websites. There is an option of completely halting the module and resuming its work when needed. Ad Blocker filters are updated automatically; however, you can change the User Filter parameters by editing the list of website URLs in its settings.

AdGuard works well with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers, therefore Ad Blocker will successfully filter the ads in any website-viewing application you may use.

AdGuard provides users with numerous filters that let you fine-tune blocking properties.

Filters receive automatic updates from AdGuard servers. Our specialists create them all manually based on user data received. You can always help other AdGuard users by sending us website URLs that you have still seen ads at.

## Browsing Security

Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing your personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they will definitely end up in the hands of criminals.

Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. In addition, the regularly updated module bases allow it to recognize malicious websites, thus securing your PC from viruses and trojans. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous).

Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, thus ensuring maximum protection.

## Parental Control

There are numerous websites access to which should be restricted if the PC is used by children. This task is accomplished by Parental Control.

The module checks the contents of web pages opened in the browser and filters those with content undesirable for children: images and texts for adults, crude language, violence, drug propaganda, etc. Parental Control settings are password protected so that the child is not able to go round the restrictions. This module not only blocks directions to undesirable sites but can also delete the links that are inappropriate for children from the search results. Filter sensitivity is flexibly adjusted.

**AdGuard Assistant**

The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. You can find detailed description of capabilities and adjustment methods of AdGuard Assistant in the relevant section of our Knowledge Database.

**AdGuard Extra**

This is a custom extension designed to fight the technique of re-inserting blocked ads - the so-called ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. Both are advanced anti-ad blocker methods that continue to rise in popularity among advertisers.

AdGuard Extra is essentially a mini-program that changes the way pages work,and it does so in such a way that it becomes much more difficult for sites to use the above-mentioned functions to bypass blockers.

**AdGuard Popup Blocker**

This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some popups are considered useful – they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the AdGuard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge Database.

**Web of Trust**

Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions. The site is rated by a number of specific criteria: trust, security, etc. This extension is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings.
