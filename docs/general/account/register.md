## What an AdGuard account is

An AdGuard account is:
1. User data, such as login credentials, preferred language and license info, that can be used for user identification;
2. A [web interface](https://auth.adguard.com/login.html) where user data can be managed.

You can log to AdGuard or [activate a license](../license/activation.md) using the login and password for your AdGuard account.

## How to create an account 

To create an account, go to [AdGuard's official website](https://adguard.com/welcome.html) and press the *My Account* button on the top right corner of the screen. Enter your email address and create a password â€” your account will be registered.

> If you enter your email address while purchasing a license or receive a license accociated with your email address as a gift, an account will be created automatically. To set a password, you can follow a link from a transactional or gift letter. You can also register with the above method.

An account can also be created directly in an AdGuard app. Press the *Log in* or *Activate* button (it can be found in the *License* section or on a separate screen), enter your email and create a password.

After the account is created, activate it by following the link in the activation email.
