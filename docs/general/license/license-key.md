## What is a license key 

A license key is a unique sequence of characters that represents an AdGuard Ad Blocker license. It is automatically registered for the email you used for license purchase. With a license key, you can:
* log in to your AdGuard account in some products (e.g. AdGuard for Windows),
* [activate your license](purchase#how-to-activate-a-license) in a product, if you don't have an AdGuard account,
* bind your license to your AdGuard account and unbind it.

> When unbinding a license, be sure you record the key in a safe place. You'll need the key for re-binding your license or transferring it to another account.

## How to recover a license key

You can easily check which license keys belong to you in your [AdGuard Account](../account/adguard-account.md).

The license key is bound to your account via the email address you used to purchase AdGuard.

**Please note** that it is often not enough to just find out what your license key is. If it was already used on another computer, itâ€™s necessary to unbind it from that computer through the AdGuard Account before using it again.
