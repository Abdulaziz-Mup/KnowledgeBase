## What is an AdGuard license 

An AdGuard license is a permission to use a specific AdGuard product.

AdGuard licenses exist in a form of license keys, activation codes, and product cards in the user's [AdGuard account](link to personal account article).

Some licenses need to be purchased (e.g. AdGuard Ad Blocker Personal), some are free and limited by term (e.g. trial licenses of AdGuard apps) or have a limited functionality (e.g. AdGuard for iOS or AdGuard Browser extension). Here's the list of all types of AdGuard Ad Blocker licenses.

2. **Free licenses** are not time-limited, but have limited functionality:
    AdGuard Browser extension,
    AdGuard Content Blocker,

3. **Subscriptions** are paid licenses that are renewed automatically every month or every year. They can also be extended manually.
    AdGuard Ad Blocker Monthly subscription,
    AdGuard Ad Blocker 1-year subscription.
4. **Licenses purchased from distributors** and **gifted licenses** are time-limited and cannot be renewed automatically. Though, they can be extended manually:
