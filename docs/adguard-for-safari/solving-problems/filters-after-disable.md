## Filtering doesn't stop even after AdGuard for Safari is disabled

This is usually caused by the issue when content blockers update takes too long.

### How to fix

 1. Open Safari.
 2. Click *Safari* in the left upper corner menu.
 3. Click *Settings…* → *Extensions* tab
 4. Uncheck checkboxes for all 6 AdGuard content blockers, this is how it should look like:

 5. Restart Safari.
 6. Check checkboxes for all 6 AdGuard content blockers again.

Now, the everything should work as intended: filtering is on when AdGuard for Safari is enabled and filtering is off when disabled.
