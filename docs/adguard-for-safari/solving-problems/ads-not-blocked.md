Sometimes, filtering may not work and ads will still show despite AdGuard for Safari and proper filters being enabled. This usually happens when something goes wrong with filter updates due to Safari bugs.

### How to fix

 1. Open Safari.
 2. Click *Safari* in the left upper corner menu.
 3. Click *Settings…* → *Extensions* tab
 4. Uncheck checkboxes for all 6 AdGuard content blockers, this is how it should look like:

 5. Restart Safari.
 6. Check checkboxes for all 6 AdGuard content blockers again.
 7. Open AdGuard for Safari settings by clicking its icon beside the Safari's search bar.
 8. Go to *Filters* tab.
 9. Click *Check for updates*.
 10. Do not close AdGuard for Safari window until filter update is finished.

If that didn't help and ads are still not blocked, please contact our support at support@adguard.com.

If you have issues only on a particular page or website, you can report it right from the browser: click AdGuard for Safari icon beside the Safari's search bar and then click *Report an issue*.
