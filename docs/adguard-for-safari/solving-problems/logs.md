## How to collect logs in AdGuard for Safari

To analyze and diagnose different problems that may potentially arise, the AdGuard support service might need AdGuard log files. These files contain records about errors and other events that occurr with the software. Below is the brief instruction describing the way to get the log files and send them to the support service if necessary.

 1. Open AdGuard for Safari settings by clicking its icon beside the Safari's search bar.
 2. Scroll down and click *Export logs*.
 3. Choose where do you want to sae the .zip file and click *Save*.

Now, you can share that file with our support team (support@adguard.com) or you can report a bug on GitHub:

 1. Create an issue on GitHub
 2. Send the log file to devteam@adguard.com. Include the time of the bug and attach a link to your issue or its number (it appears as #number next to the title).
    Alternatively, you can upload the log file to Google Drive and send it to devteam@adguard.com. Add the file link to your GitHub issue.
